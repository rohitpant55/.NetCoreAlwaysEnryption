# .NetCoreAlwaysEnryption
Console Application to provide a sample on how to use SQL Always Encryption feature with .net Core 3.1

Main motivation for me to create this project is to help other .netcore developers who have suffered to include Always Encryption feature in their project. The articles currently available online even though mention that the steps will work with .netcore but in reality the nuget packages mentioned only work with .net framework.

This project only contains the code to show how to setup application to use this feature in .netcore. To learn about what is enryption and how to setup encryption in sql please follow microsoft links -
